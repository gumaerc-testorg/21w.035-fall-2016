- The three articles cover the same topic, yet each article is progressively specialized for a particular audience, and each is written in a different genre.
- What are the main differences among the texts (e.g. length, organization, and word choice)?
- Why might one genre be valued more by certain audiences, and less (or not at all) by other audiences?
- Note: The peer-reviewed journal article is difficult to read because it’s for a specialized, expert audience. Do not try to understand all of the content, and instead focus on the form and organization.
